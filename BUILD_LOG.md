# Build log

Read this first each session. Keep it to one page.

## Rules
1. Simulation is separate from the screen.
2. Fixed random seed; every run is replayable.
3. Content lives in `data/`, not in code.
4. Every playtest records decisions, pauses and waits.
5. Desktop browser only for the slice.
6. Numbers before art. Change numbers before scope.

## Decisions
- Heat disables officers first (station down, officer shaken); named officers never die; unnamed crew can be lost.
- Pause only at crew-raised points; "ask for options" is the escape valve.
- Odds: point estimate with a confidence band that widens as data ages.
- Heat leaks: above ~40% the enemy can detect the ship passively. Venting leaves a bloom (~15 game minutes).
- Cutter is tied to the relay.

## Status
- 2026-10-22: repository created. Next: Week 0 (extend the simulation with leak and bloom, run all play styles).
